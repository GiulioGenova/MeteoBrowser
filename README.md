[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/135680776.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/135680776)

A Shiny App to download the meteorological time series from the Open Data - Province of Bozen 

To run the application install the package:

```R
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("GiulioGenova/MeteoBrowser")
```
and then use the function run_app

```R
MeteoBrowser::run_app('MeteoBrowser')
```

A stable online version is available here:

http://meteobrowser.eurac.edu/


How to:
-------

Once selected the stations and measurements (also possible to draw a polygon on the map) and chosen a date range, 
you are ready to download (the dataset available refers to the last three years).
When download is complete, a "save" icon pops up and you can choose to save a csv or a json file.
You can choose between different time aggregations. "raw" preserves the timestamp of the sensor you are
downloading (usually 5 or 10 minutes). For the other time aggregation options you will get different statistics
for each measurement in the selected timespan.
